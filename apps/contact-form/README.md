# Contact Form

Difficulty: Easy

Company: Lyft

# Description

Building forms is a common task in Front End. This exercise is meant to be finished only via HTML, but since we don't have a server to consume the form data, we'll have to make our own server to mock the POST request as well in JavaScript.

# Requirements

The form needs to contain the following elements:

- `Name` field

- `Email` field

- `Message` field. Can be input or textarea

- Submit button that contains "Send" and it should submit the form.

- There's no need to do client-side validation. Leave that to your mock server to handle that.
