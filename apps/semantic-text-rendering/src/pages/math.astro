<h2>Algebra Puzzle by MathIsFun.com</h2>
<p>
    <!-- Solution includes <kbd> which is a Keyboard Input element; I don't know why it's used for this line, better to use <span>, <p>, or a heading element that changes the font size and font family.  -->
    <kbd>Solve the following (each letter is a different digit):</kbd>
    <div><var>CAT = (C + A + T) &#215; C &#215; A &#215; T</var></div>
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
    <var>135 = (1 + 3 + 5) &#215; 1 &#215; 3 &#215; 5</var>
    <div>If you allow <var>A=T</var>, then another solution (supplied by Bill Elliott) is: </div>
<p>
    <!-- <sup> is subscript -->
    <var>144 = (1 + 4 + 4) &#215; 1 &#215; 4<sup>2</sup></var></p>
